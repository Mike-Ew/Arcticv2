Introduction

P

olar sea ice forms an interface
between the upper part of the ocean
and the lower part of the atmosphere.
Sea ice changes the radiation balance
and energy balance on the ocean surface and isolates the heat exchange
and water vapor exchange between
the ocean and the atmosphere. The
freezing and thawing process of sea
ice affects the formation and intensity
of ocean currents. Polar sea ice plays
an important role in the global climate system.
Meanwhile, sea ice is a major barrier for ship trafﬁc in the polar area.
Sea ice ﬂoes are dangerous for most
ships and ﬁshing vessels. It is also difﬁcult for icebreakers and ice-strengthened vessels to navigate the area with
high sea ice concentration and thick
ice. One typical case is that Chinese
icebreaking research vessel Snow
Dragon, which was trapped in thick
ice ﬂoes during an international Antarctic rescue mission in January 2014.
With the opening of the polar ship-

ABSTRACT
With the movement and destructiveness of sea ice, conventional in situ instruments are restricted or unavailable for polar sea ice observation. Satellite remote
sensing is a feasible way to monitor sea ice in the polar area. Multispectral imaging spectrometer and synthetic aperture radar are applied to monitoring the sea
ice in this article with high spatial resolution, wide swath, and continuous imaging.
The sea ice distribution and motion can be measured by analyzing satellite remote
sensing images. The image segmentation method is presented in the article to
obtain the sea ice distribution. Meanwhile, the cross-correlation algorithm to
extract sea ice motion is proposed as well as the processed vector results.
Keywords: remote sensing, sea ice concentration, sea ice motion, image segmentation, cross-correlation

ping routes and polar resource utilization, more attention is paid to navigation safety in the polar area, and polar
ice monitoring is one of the important factors.
Because of the low temperature,
strong winds, and the movement and
potential destructive nature of sea ice
ﬂoes, conventional in situ oceanographic
measuring techniques are restricted or
unavailable in the polar area. Under
these circumstances satellite remote
sensing is the only feasible method to
monitor the ocean parameters with
high spatial resolution. Polar ice parameters such as ice concentration,
ice thickness, ice surface temperature,
ice emissivity, snow on ice, sea ice
drift, and so on, can be observed or
estimated by remote sensing sensors
such as multispectral imaging spectrometers, microwave radiometers,
microwave scatterometers, radar altimeters, synthetic aperture radar
(SAR), and so forth. Meanwhile,
the polar area can be mapped in overlap mode by the sun-synchronous

polar orbiting satellite, and data
with higher sampling frequency and
ﬁne grid can be obtained than that
in low latitudes.
The sea ice distribution and its
concentration can be calculated by
applying image segmentation methods
to satellite images. The sea ice motion
can be estimated by analyzing the
satellite remote sensing images with
motion estimation methods (Flores
et al., 1995; Liu & Zhao, 1999;
Thomas et al., 2008, 2011; Hollands
& Dierking, 2011; Sun et al., 2015).
In this article, the image segmentation method and motion estimation
method are presented in detail, and
some optical and SAR satellite remote
sensing images are provided to validate the performance of the proposed
methods.

between sea ice and sea water/land, sea ice can be discriminated in satellite images by using image segmentation
methods, and sea ice distribution and concentration can be calculated.
Optimal thresholding segmentation is an effective tool to separate the object from the background in image processing.
The effect of image segmentation depends on the choice of threshold value. The Otsu method based on discriminant
analysis is one of the most popular classical segmentation algorithms, which maximizes the gray level histogram variance
to obtain the best separation of classes (Otsu, 1979; Xu et al., 2011).
Let the satellite image histogram be represented in L levels: [gmin, gmin þ δg, Λ, gmax], where gmin is the gray level
gmax  gmin
minimum, g max is the gray level maximum, and δg ¼
. The probability of occurrence at the ith level is

pi ¼

N is the total number of image pixels.
Suppose that the satellite image pixels can be dichotomized into two classes, C0 and C1 (background and sea ice), by a
threshold up to kth level, C0 and C1 denotes the satellite image pixels with levels [gmin, gmin þ δ g, Λ, gmin þ (k  1) ⋅ δg] and [gmin +

omize the background and sea ice is given as gt = gmin + (k*  1) ⋅ δg.
Sea ice segmentation from the satellite image involves two steps. In the ﬁrst step, median ﬁltering is applied to the image for
reducing pepper noise. Second, the Otsu segmentation method is applied in calculating the threshold value, and the satellite
image is separated into two parts by comparing the pixel value with the threshold .

Sea Ice Motion Estimation Method

The sea ice velocity ﬁeld can be estimated from the displacements of the sea ﬂoes in two images between two instances of
time. Since an individual ﬂoe cannot be detected easily and accurately in the remote sensing images, the subarea matching is
adopted in this article. The sea ice motion estimation methods include cross-correlation methods (Thomas et al., 2008; Hollands
& Dierking, 2011; Sun et al. 2015) and optical ﬂow methods (Gutierrez & Long, 2003; Bruhn et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2016).
According to the authors’ experience, cross-correlation methods are preferred because the sea ice ﬂoes can be treated as rigid
objects. Meanwhile, optical ﬂow methods are quite time consuming.
The subarea of the ﬁrst remote sensing image at t1 can be assumed as p(x, y) ¼ f (x, y) to represent the pixel intensity, and
that of the second remote sensing image at t2 can be expressed as q(x, y) = f (x  Δx, y  Δy) with the displacement of (Δx, Δy).
The cross-correlation function of p(x, y) and q(x, y), and the autocorrelation function of f (x, y) are deﬁned as

Then,

rpq τ x ; τ y ¼ rff τ x  Δx; τ y  Δy

ð2Þ

Because any autocorrelation function is even and the maximum value is located at the original point, the inequality can be
derived as rpq (τx, τy) ≤ rpq (Δx, Δy). The displacement during Δt = t2 – t1 can be estimated to be (Δx, Δy) from the
maximum position of the cross-correlation function. Scaling this displacement with the geographical factor, the sea ice
motion can be calculated quantitatively. The cross-correlation can be implemented efﬁciently by the fast Fourier transform
or the fast Hartley transform (Sun, 2002) as demonstrated below.

forward transforms and one inverse transform.

Satellite Data and Preprocessing Operation
There are two types of remote sensing images that can be used for highresolution sea ice analysis—one is the optical and infrared remote sensing
image, and the other is SAR image. The optical and infrared images used
in the article can be accessed from LANCE-MODIS (Land, Atmosphere

operated by the GSFC Terrestrial
Information Systems Laboratory
(LANCE-MODIS, 2018), and the
SAR images can be accessed from
Polar View (Karvonen et al., 2007),
which is the organization for the provision of operational, satellite-based
monitoring of the polar regions and
the cryosphere (Polar View, 2018).

Optical Data
LANCE-MODIS can provide
near-real-time optical and infrared
MODIS data sampled by Aqua and
Terra, and true-color or pseudocolor
images can be generated by choosing
different spectrometer bands. Polar
View is an international consortium
providing a wide variety of satellite
earth observation products in the
polar region and parts of midlatitude regions that monitor sea ice
cover, glacier runoff, snow cover,
snow melt, icebergs, river ice, and
lake ice. Accurate and real-time
cost-saving information can be
found at the Polar View website
(http://polarview.org/).
True-color MODIS images with
the spatial resolution of 250 m, captured on August 10 and 11, 2018
(source: http://lance-modis.eosdis.

and the map coordinate system is
WGS 1984 NSIDC Sea Ice Polar
Stereographic North.

SAR Data
SAR instruments can work at all
weather, day and night, and the optical payloads can only observe the sea
surface with good lighting conditions,
without cloud contamination. It is
clear that the quality of SAR sea ice

images.
High-resolution SAR images can be
downloaded from http://www.
polarview.aq. The images provided by
the website have been calibrated, and
up-to-the-minute images are provided.
The images are categorized according
to the region, time sequence, and so
on (Polar View, 2018). Two SAR
images generated by Radarsat2 are
illustrated in Figure 2, where the
giant white object is a grounded
iceberg named as A23A with a size as
large as 44 × 40 nautical miles. The
map coordinate system is WGS 1984
Antarctic Polar Stereographic.

Geographical Matching
There is a little difference between
Figures 1 and 2. The geographical
matching operation is applied to
Figure 2 to get the same region
with the same spatial resolution for
the next sea ice motion estimation.
The images in Figure 2 with the overlapped area can be used to calculate
the sea ice motion vectors. The map
overlaid with latitude and longitude
lines can be extracted from the satellite image, which is orthogonal to
each other. Concerned as X- junctions
(Chu et al., 2013; Pham et al., 2014;
Hansard et al., 2014), the intersections of the map lines in Figure 2
can be detected automatically and accurately for matching and zooming
the satellite images. The geographical matched images are illustrated
in Figure 3.
During software implementation,
a grid of interrogation areas is built
with the same size within each satellite image. The size of the interrogation area is set to be greater than
twice the estimated sea ice displacement. The corresponding interrogation areas are then processed quickly

and clouds cannot be distinguished by
the Otsu segmentation method. The
SAR image segmentation is not affected by clouds or other atmospheric
phenomena. According to the segmentation results, the size distribution and concentration of sea ice can
be calculated easily for operational
application.

Sea Ice Motion

with the help of the fast algorithm of
cross-correlation, and the mean velocity
between two interrogation areas is obtained. This process is repeated at each
grid point within the satellite images,
resulting in a map of velocity vectors
to describe the polar sea ice motion.

Results
Applying the segmentation and
cross-correlation methods described

in the previous section to the remote
sensing sea ice images, the sea ice
distribution and motion can be
obtained.

Applying cross-correlation method to MODIS images in Figure 1
and SAR images in Figure 3, the
velocity vector maps can be calculated
as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. It is
obvious that the mesoscale sea ice dipole vortex and dynamic eddy can be
discovered with the detailed information in Figures 6 and 7.

polar regions has been introduced in
many earlier studies (Emery et al.,

the trend of thesea ice drift. The validation is conducted with the medium resolution sea ice drift product from
2018-08-10 05:37 to 2018-08-11
05:16 in the Arctic region and the
low-resolution sea ice drift product
from 2014-04-12 12:00 to 2014-0414 12:00 in the Antarctic region of the
EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (http://www.
osi-saf.org/), which the continuous
maximum cross-correlation is applied
to motion tracking (Lavergne et al.,
2010). The sea ice drift products are
illustrated in Figures 8 and 9 with the
map coordinate system of Oblique
Mercator projection.
Comparing Figures 6 and 8 with
Figures 7 and 9, the distribution of
the sea ice drift velocity and direction
are basically consistent, which can validate the reliability of the analysis results provided in the article.

Conclusions and Prospects
It is useful for navigation safety to
monitor polar sea ice distribution and
motion by analyzing satellite remote

sensing images. The sea ice distribution can be calculated by the image
segmentation methods, and the sea
ice motion can be derived by calculating the cross-correlation function of
the satellite remote sensing images.
The mesoscale sea ice dynamic phenomena can be inferred from the velocity vector map clearly with the
detailed information, which is helpful
for the study of polar sea ice dynamics.
Compared with optical remote sensing
images, the SAR images are more suitable for polar sea ice monitoring in the
region covered by clouds and fog.
Since the sea ice distribution and
motion is caused by the topographic,
atmospheric, and oceanic forcing, the
results in a given polar area calculated
by the proposed methods can be used
as initial conditions and applied to the
polar sea ice forecasting by combining
numerical meteorological and oceanic
modeling.
