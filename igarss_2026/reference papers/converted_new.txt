Abstract
Sea ice mapping on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is important for various purposes, including ship
navigation and usage in environmental and climatological
studies. Although a series of deep learning-based models
have been proposed for automatic sea ice classification on
SAR scenes, most of them are flat N-way classifiers that
do not consider the uneven visual separability of different
sea ice types. To further improve classification accuracy
with limited training samples, a hierarchical deep learningbased pipeline is proposed for sea ice mapping from SAR.
First, a semantic segmentation model with encoder-decoder
structure is implemented to accurately separate ice and
open water on each SAR scene. To classify different ice
types, a two-level category hierarchical convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model is then trained using limited numbers of labeled image patches. Experimental results on dual-polarized SAR scenes collected from C-band
satellite RADARSAT-2 show that ice-water mapping results
are in very good accordance with pixel-based labels under different combinations of encoders and decoders. Also,
compared to a flat N-way CNN, the hierarchical CNNs further boosts the classification accuracy among all the ice
types.

1. Introduction
The monitoring and classification of arctic sea ice is crucial for ship navigation and climate change prediction in polar regions [39, 21]. Satellite borne synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) is an advantageous remote sensor for sea ice classification because it can obtain high resolution imagery in different polarizations under all weather conditions. The variance of dielectric properties and surface features between
different types of sea ice (as well as open water) leads to

different backscattering characteristics and textures on SAR
imagery [29]. On the other hand, the interactions between
the SAR signal and sea ice are also affected by many other
factors (e.g., imaging frequency, incidence angle, temperature, and wind speed), which makes SAR sea-ice images
hard to interpret [34]. Since operational sea ice charting
from dual-polarized SAR imagery based on manual labeling is laborious and coarse on both spatial and temporal
resolution, various automatic sea ice classification methods using computer vision techniques have been proposed
in past two decades. Algorithms vary from traditional machine learning (ML)-based classifiers using backscatter and
texture features [24, 19, 13, 28, 37, 26, 30, 23, 7] to deep
learning (DL)-based models with automatic feature extraction [3, 29, 20, 38, 39] proposed in the past few years.
Compared to traditional classifiers, DL-based models (such
as convolutional neural networks) are end-to-end pipelines
that do not utilize a complex feature engineering process.
However, they still have certain limitations. For example,
due to the coarse resolution of the reference ground truths
(i.e., sea ice charts), it is practically impossible to produce
pixel-based ice type labels with 100% accuracy. Hence, the
high classification accuracy reported by some studies that
used the coarse ice charts as ground truths might not be
reliable. Also, deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
models trained with limited number of labeled samples are
prone to overfitting with poor generalization ability. The
imbalanced sample numbers between different ice types
also negatively affect the classification accuracy of certain
ice types. Hence, a robust DL-based sea ice classification
model trained with limited labeled samples needs to be further pursued.
In SAR sea ice imagery, the visual separability of different categories is usually uneven. For example, it is generally
much easier to visually separate between ice and open water
regions than two specific ice types. Most of the CNN-based

sea ice mapping models are flat N-way classifiers, which
may not perform well on ice types that are difficult to classify. Previous works have shown that organizing classifiers
in a hierarchical manner can further boost the classification
accuracy [35, 16, 36, 2]. Thus, in this paper, a hierarchical classification approach is proposed to classify sea ice in
dual-polarized SAR imagery. Despite the challenges in sea
ice type classification, ice-water mapping for SAR imagery
is a more straightforward task as the differences in backscatter coefficient and textures are quite distinct between ice and
water. Hence, a semantic segmentation model is first trained
to segment each SAR scene into two classes, i.e., ice and
open water. Then, small image patches sampled from ice
regions are labeled with different ice types (e.g., multi-year
ice, first-year ice, new ice, grey/grey white ice) and used to
a hierarchical CNN-based model that decomposes the classification task into two steps. Comparison of testing results
shows that the proposed scheme outperforms CNN-based
models that conduct flat classification at one time.
A brief introduction of the dataset used in this study is
provided in Section 2. The details of each level in the proposed hierarchical pipeline are illustrated in Section 3. Experimental result analysis and comparison are given Section
4, followed by the conclusions and future work in Section
5.

concentration levels. For example, the light blue and red
represent open water and 90%+ sea ice concentration, respectively. More information about the dataset can be found
in several previous works concerning sea ice classification
and concentration estimation [17, 31, 12, 11, 10].

training in this study.

2. Data Overview
The SAR imagery used in this study for model training
and testing consist of 35 scenes collected from the C-band
SAR satellite RADARSAT-2 in the Beaufort Sea. They
were all captured in the ScanSAR wide mode with HH
and HV-polarizations being provided and an incidence angle ranging from 20◦ to 49◦ . The images were obtained
from April to December in the years of 2010 (21 scenes)
and 2011 (14 scenes). The locations of the 21 scenes in
2010 are depicted in Fig. 1. The pixel spacing is 50 m
and the size of each image is around 10000 × 10000 pixels.
To improve computational efficiency, the original images
are downsampled using 4 × 4 block averaging. The image analysis charts that cover the locations of SAR imagery
are available for some of the scenes, which are provided by
a Canada Ice Service (CIS)-trained analyst are used to obtain reference for the labeling of training samples. For each
scene, a land mask is provided to exclude pixels of the land
from the study. An example of a SAR scene in HH and
HV channels with its land mask and image analysis chart is
depicted in Fig. 2. For the image analysis chart, the values and abbreviations printed on each polygon indicate a
certain sea ice concentration level with certain proportions
of different ice types. For example, the ”9+, 8my 2fy” on
the polygon on the top indicate 90%+ sea ice concentration with 80% of ice as multi-year ice and the 20% left as
first-year ice. Different colors also indicate different sea ice

3.1. Ice-water mapping using semantic segmentation models
In recent years many CNN-based models have been proposed for ice-water mapping in dual-polarized SAR imagery [3, 25, 32, 12, 10]. Although relatively high accuracy
have been reported, visual observation of the mapping results on the whole scene shows that they are still coarse and
less precise in some regions, especially around ice-water
boundaries during the melting and freeze-up seasons. That
is because small-size image patches are used as the inputs
of the CNN classification models and those models cannot
learn features from a larger receptive field. Since the classification between ice and water regions can be also treated as
a semantic segmentation task, the DL-based semantic segmentation model with encoder-decoder structure is a favorable choice for ice-water classification. By referring to image analysis charts and visual observation, pixel-based icewater map is labeled for each scene manually and used as
ground truth for model training and evaluation.

In this paper, a number of state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic segmentation models with different combinations of
encoders (backbones) and decoders are evaluated and compared with each other using the MMSegmentation library
[5]. It is an open source semantic segmentation toolbox
based on PyTorch with various DL models/backbones in-

corporated (e.g., UNet [27], ResNet [8], Vision transformer
[6], and Swin transformer [18]). As the input image of
the models in MMSegmentation should be an RGB image,
the input of our model is a Pseudo RGB SAR scene with
the three channels consisting of the pixel intensities in HH,
HV channels and their average values (i.e., HH/2+HV/2),
as shown in Fig. 4. A list of the parameters of the semantic segmentation models trained in this work is given
in Table 1. To make the model scale-invariant, a data aug-

mentation pipeline that resizes and randomly crops from
the current image is adopted. Specifically, a ratio is first
randomly sampled from the ratio range (i.e., [0.5, 2]) and
multiply it with the image scale, which corresponds to the
size of the resized image. A 512 × 512 window is then applied to randomly crop the resized image, which produces
the input patch for training the model. To avoid class imbalance issue, as well as to ensure that the model performs
well on ice-water boundaries, the maximum ratio that single
category (i.e., ice or water) could occupy in each training
patch is set as 0.75. The algorithm used for the optimizer
is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and mean Intersection
over Union (mIoU) is used as the evaluation metric. For
model testing, a 512 × 512 sliding window is applied to
the input SAR scene with a stride of 170 to produce pixelbased mapping results. Experimental results using a couple
of models and backbones are presented in Section 4.

3.2. Ice type classification with a hierarchy of CNNs
Although in the open water regions identified in the icewater classification, some new ice with crust up to 10 centimetres in thickness may still exist, they are in small portions and do not pose danger on ship navigation. Therefore,
in the step of ice type classification, regions/pixels that are
identified as water can be masked out from the training and
evaluation of the sea ice type classification model. Based on
image analysis charts and visual observation, we label certain numbers of data points in each scene manually for training and validating the classification model. Specifically, instead of simply labeling on certain regions, scribble-based
annotations are drawn in different ice regions, as shown in
Fig. 5. Among ice types with different stages of development, the multi-year ice (MYI) tends to have the high0
) at
est HH-polarization backscatter coefficient (i.e., σHH
C-band with relatively distinct patterns [22]. Thus, it is
reasonable for the hierarchical classifier to first classify between MYI and other ice types. Labeled patches that do
not belong to the MYI are then further classified into three
classes based on their thickness: new ice (NI), grey ice/grey
white ice (GI/GWI), and first-year ice (FYI) by training another CNN. The order of thickness range for different ice
types is: M Y I > F Y I > GW I > GI > N I. The number of labeled patches for each ice type is listed on Table
2. Details about the physical characteristics of each type
of ice can be found in [1]. Since GI and GWI are usually
mixed with each other and the resolution of the image analysis charts is coarse, the uncertainty of labeling them would
be high. Thus, they are classified as one category instead
of being labeled separately in this work. To facilitate visual evaluation, examples of regions dominated with different ice types in HH channel of the C-band RADARSAT-2
SAR imagery are depicted in Fig. 6. Noted that SAR scenes
obtained from the melting season (i.e, from June to Septem-

ber) are excluded from the ice type classification study. That
is because the wet or melted snow strongly reduces the SAR
penetration depth and thus suppresses the volume scattering contribution of sea ice [40]. In consequence, the contrast between backscatter intensities of different ice types
observed by SAR is decreased and thus prevents the classification model from identifying different ice types correctly.

types (here red and yellow lines correspond to multi-year ice and
first-year ice, respectively) produced from scribble-based labels.

The AlexNet [15] is adopted as the structure for the each
embedded CNN due to its good performance on limited
number of samples. As shown in Table 3, the input patch
size is determined empirically as 33. That is because a
smaller patch size cannot obtain enough spatial information
while the classification results produced by a larger patch
size might be too coarse. The Adam optimizer proposed by
Kingma and Ba [14] is used to optimize the model parameters. The patience of training is set as 6, which corresponds
to the number of epochs with no improvement after which
learning rate will be reduced by a factor of 0.1 (i.e., new
learning rate = old learning rate × 0.1). To prevent overfitting, 20% of the randomly-selected weight values in the
CNN are set as zero during the training process and 20% of
the training samples are used for validation.

4.1. Ice-water mapping results
The training set is obtained from the 21 SAR scenes in
2010, while the 14 scenes in 2011 are all used for testing. In
our experiment various models with different combinations
of encoders/backbones and decoders are compared with

els that are “misclassified” as ice could actually be new ice.
Given the limitations of numerical analysis, examples of
mapping results are provided in Fig. 7 for visual evaluation.
It can be observed that results produced by all the semantic
segmentation models are in good accordance with manual
labels. The main variations are around the ice-water boundaries, which is plausible as it is hard for both the expert and
the model to distinguish melting/thin ice.

each other. Due to the page limit and their similar testing
accuracy, only a few of them are presented here, as shown
in Table 4. Details about the structures of those backbones
and decoders are illustrated in the papers listed in Table 4.
Numerical results show that the various models have similar testing accuracy. Also, the combination of UNet-based
backbone and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP)-based
decoder head obtains the highest mIoU. Noted that the classification accuracy of ice is generally higher than that of
open water. For operational use (e.g., ship navigation), this
is acceptable because for the sake of safety, we would rather
prefer water misclassified as ice rather than ice misclassified
as water. Also, since manual labeling might not be always
correct, especially around ice-water boundaries, water pix-

In our pipeline, the ice-water mapping results produced
by the UNet-based semantic segmentation model are first
used to mask out open water regions from ice type classification. To present the testing results numerically, the
confusion matrix of the ice type classification results using
labeled samples is presented in Table 5. It can be observed
that three types of ice have classification accuracy of more
than 85%. The relatively high accuracy for MYI and FYI
could be due to their consistent patterns and backscatter intensities, which facilitate the model to identify them correctly. In contrast, this is challenging for NI and GI/GWI
mainly appeared in the melting/freeze-up seasons because
they tend to have variant patterns and backscatter intensities
(as shown in Fig. 6). This also accounts for the relatively
low accuracy of NI. Besides, it can be observed that for a
certain ice type, if it is misclassified, it is most likely to be
classified into another ice type with an adjacent thickness
range. In particular, 11% of YI is misclassified as GI/GWI.
This is reasonable as the difference of thickness between NI
and GI is relatively small and human labeling error is more
likely to occur.
To validate the effectiveness of hierarchical CNNs in accuracy improvement, the confusion matrix obtained from
another AlexNet-based CNN model trained using 4 ice
types directly without hierarchical structure is listed in Table 6 for comparison. It can be observed that the hierarchical CNNs further boost the testing accuracy among all the
ice types, especially for MYI (the accuracy is improved by
16.6%). This is consistent with the assumption that with
limited training samples and uneven visual separability, hierarchical classifiers are likely to outperform flat N-way
classifiers.
As shown in Fig. 8, examples of ice type classification results on several SAR scenes are provided for visual
evaluation. Scenes obtained in winter (e.g., two scenes on
the top) mainly consist of MYI and FYI, which can be accurately separated by the hierarchical CNNs. Noted that
there are a few FYI pixels between the gap of MYI that
are misclassified as NI. During the freeze-up season (e.g.,
the scene on middle left obtained on October), NI takes the
majority around ice-water boundaries. GI and GWI become
prevalent as the distance between ice and water goes further.
Then, in November and December (e.g., two scenes at the

into a two-level category hierarchy. In this way, ice regions
are first classified into two coarse categories: multi-year ice
and others. Non multi-year ice are then further decomposed
into three fine categories: new ice, grey/grey white ice, and
first-year ice. Experimental results on SAR scenes obtained
from C-band satellite RADARSAT-2 show that compared to
previously proposed flat N-way classification approaches,
the hierarchical pipeline improves the classification performance significantly on both numerical analysis and visual
evaluation. Future work will focus on further classifying
the ice into more detailed categories if more data and labels
are available. In addition, ice type classification model that
can perform well in melting season needs to be investigated.
