Abstract It is difficult to balance local details and global distribution using a single source image in marine target detection of a
large scene. To solve this problem, a technique based on the fusion of optical image and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image for the
extraction of sea ice is proposed in this paper. The Band 2 (B2) image of Sentinel-2 (S2) in the research area is selected as optical
image data. Preprocessing on the optical image, such as resampling, projection transformation and format conversion, are conducted
to the S2 dataset before fusion. Imaging characteristics of the sea ice have been analyzed, and a new deep learning (DL) model,
OceanTDL5, is built to detect sea ices. The fusion of the Sentinel-1 (S1) and S2 images is realized by solving the optimal pixel values
based on deriving Poisson Equation. The experimental results indicate that the use of a fused image improves the accuracy of sea ice
detection compared with the use of a single data source. The fused image has richer spatial details and a clearer texture compared
with the original optical image, and its material sense and color are more abundant.

1 Introduction
The occurrence of sea ice may cause port freezing and
tunnel blocking, even affect marine fisheries. Therefore,
the detection and extraction of sea ice are extremely important. The existing researches on marine target detection are mainly focused on ships, e.g., ship target detection
based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images (Hwang
et al., 2017; Iervolino and Guida, 2017; Hwang and Jung,
2018; Cui et al., 2019) and optical images (Chen and Gong,
2010; Zhu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Mattyus, 2013;
Ren, 2016; Ji et al., 2017; Nie et al., 2017; Heiselberg,
2019).
Spaceborne SAR (synthetic aperture radar) has been proven to be an effective tool for monitoring sea ice (Ressel
et al., 2016; Miguel et al., 2017), and over the years, sea
ice detection technique based on SAR images has been
significantly improved. Herzfeld et al. (2016) applied geostatistical methods to automatically classify sea ice by using SAR data. Ressel and Singha (2016) compared the polarimetric backscatter characteristics of sea ice in spaceborne X and C band SAR images and proposed a supervised classification algorithm for sea ice. Fang et al. (2007)
proposed a multiclass classification method for a large
area glacier by using spaceborne single-polarimetric SAR
intensity image. They also constructed a linear classifier

with the supervised neighborhood embedding via sparse
characteristic representation (Fang et al., 2017). Lohse et al.
(2019) proposed a numerically optimized decision-tree
algorithm, which was applied in the classification of sea
ice using SAR data. Xie et al. (2020) proposed a method
for differentiating seawater from sea ice by using quadpolarized C band SAR image. Johansson et al. (2020) investigated a method for identifying oil slick and sea ice
by using SAR image. Park et al. (2016) proposed a classification algorithm for sea ice in Sentinel-1 (S1) image
based on a machine learning model.
To compensate for the deficiency of SAR image, which
is difficult to be interpreted, some scholars use multispectral images to classify and detect sea ice (Han et al., 2016;
Heiselberg and Heiselberg, 2017; Su et al., 2019; MacGregor et al., 2020). Typically, Barbieux et al. (2018) proposed an algorithm to distinguish the ice from open water
on ice lakes by using multispectral data obtained from
Landsat 8. This algorithm has a significantly high optimal
threshold stability, which can better separate the ice/water
mixture from the ground. Han et al. (2018) proposed a
classification framework for the detection of sea ice, which
combines active learning (AL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL), by using transductive support vector machine
to classify high spectral and multispectral images.
The fusion of SAR and optical images in the existing
researches is mainly applied in land classification (Liu
et al., 2017; Sukawattanavijit et al., 2017; Aswatha et al.,
2020). To exploit the advantages of SAR and multispectral data, some scholars adopt the fusion of SAR and mul-

tispectral images to marine target detection (Park et al.,
2018). Vijay and Gopalan (2012) used the images captured by TerraSAR-X and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite to analyze the glacial characteristics in the Himalayas
by using the IHS (intensity, hue, saturation) fusion technology and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based
technology. Shah et al. (2019) employed the pixel-based
technology to fuse the images captured by Radar Imaging
Satellite-1 and RESOURCESAT-2. Compared with the original multispectral and SAR images, the fusion image provides an improved recognition of characteristics, such as
blue ice and lake ice. Yu et al. (2019) proposed a new sea
ice classification framework based on locality, which
classifies the pixels of the fused image by using a sliding
integration strategy and retains the local characteristic of
the source image in both the spatial and characteristic domains. Heiselberg (2020) optimized a convolutional neural network with a series of hyperparameters and used S1
(Sentinel-1) SAR and S2 (Sentinel-2) multispectral images in the experiments to achieve an improved ship and
iceberg classification accuracy.
In general, the fusion of SAR and multispectral images
is mainly applied in land classification and less in marine
target detection. In the field of marine target detection,
numerous researches focus more on ships detection and
less on sea ice detection. Moreover, for sea ice detection,
most works mainly adopt SAR or optical image as single
data source. Also, the fusion of SAR and optical images is

rarely used for the detection and extraction of sea ice.
Thus, in this paper, such a fusion image is employed, and
the spectral color and interpretation characteristics of multispectral images are exploited to compensate for the deficiencies of SAR image and improve the accuracy of sea
ice detection.

2 Data
2.1 Image Data Selection
S2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data were obtained
at three resolutions: 10-m resolution, which includes four
bands; 20-m resolution, which includes six bands, four
(705, 740, 783, and 865 nm) of which are used for vegetation characteristics and two larger SWIR (Short Wave
Infra-Red) bands (1610 and 2190 nm) for snow/ice/cloud
detection or vegetation moisture assessment; and 60-m
resolution, which includes three bands that are mainly
used for cloud shielding and atmospheric correction. The
S2 image with 10-m resolution was selected, and the example of each band is shown in Table 1. In Band 4 (B4),
the clouds and fog are clearly visible. In Band 3 (B3),
they are faintly visible. In Band 8 (B8) and B2 (Band 2),
the clouds and fog cannot be seen. But in B2 the image
shows a better saturation and stronger penetration, thus
better comprehensive effect. Therefore, the B2 band data
of S2 with 10-m resolution was utilized to fuse with the
previously processed S1 SAR dataset for sea ice detection.

is shown in Fig.4.

2.2 Image Preprocessing
The SAR datasets for sea ice detection were collected
by S1 on February 9, 2016, with a file name of S1A_IW_
SLC_1SDV_20160209T215542_20160209T215609_009
875_00E783_83E7.SAFE. For the fusion of optical image
and SAR image, multispectral image data collected by S2
on February 7, 2016, are used, with the file names of
S2A_OPER_PRD_MSIL1C_PDMC_20160207T114115_
R132_V20160207T025602_20160207T025602.SAFE and

R132_V20160207T025602_20160207T025602.SAFE. The
S2 image is preprocessed according to the procedure shown
in Fig.1.
Fig.2 Resampling results.

Fig.1 S2 image preprocessing procedure.

The research area is in the Bohai Sea. The level-1C
multi-resolutions products in the north of the 51˚N in the
S2 image were resampled and converted into 10-m single-resolution data, thus obtaining a 30978×30978 pixel
image. The nearest-neighbor method is used to interpolate
the pixel values of the image, and the nearest is selected.
To improve the imaging speed, the pyramid level was
selected for resampling, and the resulting image is shown
in Fig.2. To improve the accuracy of sea ice detection, the
opaque clouds and cirrocumulus in level-1C products were
extracted in the S2 image of the research area, which are
colored in red in Fig.2. To improve the efficiency of sea
ice detection, the land in the research area needs to be
removed by setting the pixels to be null values and only
the marine area was extracted. The extracted S2 image of
the marine research area is shown in Fig.3.
To facilitate the fusion of S1 and S2 images for sea ice
detection, the two images need to be projected to the
same geographic reference system. The extracted S2 image of the marine research area was resampled by using
the nearest-neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic interpolations.
To ensure the timeliness of target detection, the nearest-neighbor interpolation is employed to reproject the S2
image in this work. Only the S2 image in the overlapped
area with the SAR image was reprojected, and the result

2.3 Image Characteristics Analysis of Sea Ice
After preprocessing, the multispectral image data with
14-m resolution, consistent with the SAR image data, were
obtained via resampling in the study area. Statistical analysis of the image characteristics of the sea ice in the research area is performed on a small number of samples
and results are shown in Fig.5. The total number of pixels
included in the statistical analysis is 12821093, and the

The statistical histogram of the overall marine research
area exhibited multiple peaks, and sea ice exhibited a
single peak. The area with an average value of 0.22296 is

determined to be sea ice. Moreover, when a small number
of sea ice samples were analyzed, a peak with the small
reflection value of near 0.17 appeared, as well as for the
overall marine research area. It is preliminarily determined
that the region with this characteristic value is covered by
semi-dissolved sea ice or sea ice covered by thin sea water. It is also found that the research area, where the reflection value is over 0.3 (5% of the total image), is mostly
covered by coastal sea ice and a small part sea ice in the
marine, not drilling platforms and coastal embankments,
which is different from that shown by the SAR image.
The comparison of the various targets between the S1 and
S2 images is shown in Fig.7.

2.4 Detection Dataset Construction
The integral data of [0, 255] after linear scaling conversion were resampled according to 14-m resolution to construct the dataset of S2 for marine target detection. The S2
dataset constructed for marine target detection includes a
total of 48984320 pixels, which provides training, testing
and verification dataset for the neural network to learn the
sea ice detection. Fig.8 shows the research area and statistical characteristics of sea water and sea ice. The areas
numbers 1–12 in the figure are sea water, which consists
of 20521200 pixels, including 26175 28×28 pixels. The
areas numbered 13–28 in the figure are covered by sea ice
with 28463120 pixels, including 36305 28×28 pixels. As
can be seen from Fig.8, there are two peaks appear for sea
ice. The single peak with a pixel value between 33 and 39
is mainly caused by semi-melting sea ice or sea ice covered by sea water, as indicated in red in the enlarged image No. 17.

3 Method

3.1.2 Sea ice initial detection
The sea ice is initially detected from the S1 and S2
images individually by using the OceanTDL5 model and
three methods including StErf (Standard Error function)
method, Loglogistic distribution method, and Sgmloglog
method that is proposed by the authors previously to extract targets. Then the results were stored as marine target
database tags_idlab.db and image_idDate.db for S1 and
S2. Before the image fusion, preliminary data processing
is carried out as the following procedure (Fig.10).

Fusion of remote sensing images is performed by processing redundant or complementary multisource remote
sensing data in space, spectrum, and time according to certain rules or algorithms. The composite image data with
new spatial, spectrum, and time characteristics generally
have more accurate and richer information compared with
any single data. In this paper, the method of solving the
optimal pixel value based on constructing Poisson Equation is used to fuse images, which can well retain the gra-

3.1 DL Based Initial Detection
3.1.1 OceanTDL5 construction
A deep learning model OceanTDL5 for sea ice detection was constructed. It is composed of 1 Layer, 1 Group
and 1 fully connected Dense (Fig.9). The organization form
of the Layer is W*X_pluse_b-relu-Dropout-reshape. The
middle Group includes 3 layers, and its organization form
is as (W*X_pluse_b-relu-Dropout-reshape)*3. The organization form of fully connected Dense Layer is W*X_
pluse_b-relu. The characteristic information is gradually
reduced through 529-121-25-9 from 784 that were input
at the beginning. Finally, a full connection containing 9
neurons is used to perform weighted summation and Relu
activate to compress to 2 characteristics, which are input
to Softmax of Loss Layer for classification.

3.2 Image Fusion Based Detection
3.2.1 Fusion method
By solving the optimal pixel values from the Poisson
Equation, the image pixels in the fusion area can be reconstructed. The algorithm is shown in Fig.11.

The iterative method is employed for the discrete computation of Eq. (1). By convoluting with Laplace convolution kernel, the divergence image of the image u to be
fused can be solved, in which Laplacian convolution kernel takes the following form:

2) Calculate the pixel values of the suspected targets in
the fused image fusionS.
The initial pixel values of the fused image (fusionS) are
calculated as follows:

In the equation, ValS1−STP denotes the pixel value of the
suspected targets in the S1 image, and m and n denote the
row and column of the pixels of suspected targets.
3) Calculate the pixel values of the non-distributed targets in the S1 image.
Read the pixel values of non-distributed targets in the
S1 image in turn and adjust the pixel values of the 3×3

sea ice of the multispectral image, presenting a visual
sense of rich color and clear texture. With regard to spectral color, the original SAR image is dark, but the brightness of the fused image is between the SAR and multispectral images. In terms of spatial detail, the fused image
is much richer than the original multispectral image and
has a strong sense of depth. From the enlarged image
(Fig.14), it can be found that the fused image is superior
to the SAR image (Fig.12) and the multi-spectral image
(Fig.13) in terms of capturing spatial details. From the
image interpretation perspective, the fused image is easier
to determine the type of marine distribution target than
the original SAR image, and is easier to spot the differences between the same types of distribution target than
the original multi-spectral image.

In the equation, j denotes the row number of the S1
image; k is the column number; and ε is the fusion coefficient. According to experimental verification, ε = 2 is adopted.
4) Fuse the pixel values of non-distributed targets into
the fused image (fusionS) of the suspected targets.
The mask image of the image clusterVal is established,
the center coordinates of the image to be fused are calculated, and the non-distributed target (clusterVal) is merged
into the suspected target (fusionS) image according to the
principle of the same boundary pixel value.

A total of 1861 pieces of sea ice are detected, at a detection rate of 99.7%. The detection accuracy is improved by
3%, the detection time is 3.65 s, and the detection ability
of the image with a 14-m resolution is near 67.2 km2 s−1.
The undetected sea ice is mainly concentrated in the confluence of sea water and sea ice, where the ice is covered

2) Quantitative analysis

ice extracted from the fused image. The sea ice detected
using DL models are shown in Fig.15, and the sea ice
detected by the fused image of S1 and S2 are shown in

5 Conclusions
For the target detection in a large sea area, it is difficult
to balance local details and global distribution just by using a single source image because of its intrinsic limitations in imaging. Therefore, in this paper, the SAR im-

ages and optical images are fused to extract sea ice in
order to take the advantages of the two types of image
sources and complement each other.
The fused image maintained the spatial details and
clear texture of the SAR image before fusion and the high
texture sense (for sea ice) and rich color of the multispectral image. The qualitative analysis reveals that in terms
of spatial details, the fused image is richer than the original multispectral image, has a sense of hierarchy, and is
superior to the original SAR image and multispectral image in terms of captured spatial details. With regard to the
spectral color, the original SAR image is darker, and the
brightness of the fused image is between the SAR and
multispectral images. From the perspective of image interpretation, the use of the fused image can determine
more easily the type of marine distribution target compared with the use of the original SAR image. Moreover,
it can determine more easily the difference between the
same types of distribution target compared with the original multispectral image.
The detection rate of the sea ice based on the fusion
data of the SAR and optical images is 99.7%. The detection accuracy is 3% higher than that of the non-fusion
model, and the detection ability for the image with a 14-m
resolution is near 67.2 km2 s−1. The undetected sea ice is
mainly concentrated in the confluence of sea water and sea

ice, where the ice is covered by water or is semi-melted.
